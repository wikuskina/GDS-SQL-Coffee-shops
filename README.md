# SQL Queries on the Database for coffee shops
## Data Science exercise
### Author Viktorija S

Case for the exercise: Independent (non-chain) coffee shop owners from several major UK cities decided to create a shared online database. The purpose of this database is to manage business-related information and share it with each other (e.g. for marketing and promotion). Coffee shop owners aim to collect and store customer data (as per all current regulations, e.g. privacy and information sharing). Collected data will be used to track customer behaviour, visits, busiest days, shop management details, etc. and share it across several coffee shops to promote sales.

Database was designed and populated with sample entries (all entries were created via online tools and are not real). Cities, locations, and population figures are real. The database was created using SQL.

The database has information on customers and their visits. Their addresses and full names are hidden but it is possible to see their geolocations. Shop owners and managers can now find out which days are busiest in the coffee shops, so they can work on better marketing strategies, promotions, and provide staff training on less busy days.
