# Database for coffee shops using SQL 
Study case, my own work.

Independent coffee shop owners from several major UK cities collaborated and decided to create an online database where they could share and manage information with each other. The requirement was to collect and store customer data (according to all recent regulations, e.g. privacy and information sharing), to track customer behaviour, coffee shop visits, busiest days, shop management details, etc. 

Database was designed and populated with sample entries (all entries were created via online tools and are not real).
Customer details are hidden (their addresses and full names), however it is possible to see their geolocations.
